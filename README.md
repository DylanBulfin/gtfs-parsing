# GTFS Parsing
This is a project that seeks to parse [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/documentation/overview/) schedule data into a well-typed format. It will first and foremost be used for MTA subway data since that's what interests me the most, but I do think it would be interesting to provide basic support for other systems (that's the point of a standard after all).
